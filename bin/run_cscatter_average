Run Cscatter_average to calculate optical properties of a given constituent
averaged on model spectral bands. The output is saved in
data/cscatter/avg_sw_<type> and data/cscatter/avg_lw_<type>.

Usage: run_cscatter <type>

Arguments:

- type: Type of constituent (one of: "fibers", "fragments", "fragments_fit").

Examples:

Calculate averaged optical properties of fibers.

bin/run_cscatter_average fibers

Calculate averaged optical properties of fragments.

bin/run_cscatter_average fragments

Calculate averaged optical properties of fragments (fit).

bin/run_cscatter_average fragments_fit
